# Checkpoint summary â€” 2025-09-09 21:52:50 WIB

Automated checkpoint executed by `scripts/checkpoint.js`.

- Files inspected: `currentTask.md`, `log_aktifitas.md`, `perencanaan.md`, `struktur_proyek.md`, `to_do.md`, `urutan_pekerjaan_teknis.md`
- Backend tests: passed (1 attempt)
- Log file: `logs/checkpoint-20250909-215250.log`

Brief findings:
- Inventory stock-in endpoints sometimes returned 500 in earlier attempts but later test runs passed; validation for `cabang_id` is in place and returns 422 for invalid input.
- Seed script `be/scripts/seed_test_users.js` creates two users (pemilik@test.local, kasir@test.local) with hashed passwords; `be/scripts/seed_undo_test_users.js` added to remove them.
- OpenAPI is exposed at `docs/openapi.yaml` and served at `/api/docs/swagger`.

Next recommended steps:
1. Add `seed:undo` to `be/package.json` (done).
2. Document undo and seed steps in `be/README.md` (updated).
3. Consider adding CI job that runs `npm run seed:test` on a disposable DB to validate seed scripts.
